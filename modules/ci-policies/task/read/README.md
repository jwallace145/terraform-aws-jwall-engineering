# task/read

Read the configuration of a project's task results bucket,
`<name_root>-<project>-tasks`, for `terraform plan` and refresh. It never
reads the results themselves. The task runner's other resources (launch
template, instance role, security group, log group) are already readable
through [`container/read`](../../container/read). Class: **read**.

Part of the [`ci-policies`](../..) catalog. Request it from a CI role module
with `policies = ["task/read"]`; it is not meant to be called directly.
