# task/manage

Create and manage a project's task launch template (by the `Project` tag)
and the configuration of its task results bucket (by name, never its
objects). The task instance role, instance profile, security group and log
group are covered by [`container/manage`](../../container/manage). Class:
**write**; pair it with [`task/read`](../read).

Part of the [`ci-policies`](../..) catalog. Request it from a CI role module
with `policies = ["task/manage"]`; it is not meant to be called directly.

## Known gaps

| Statement | Why it is `*` |
|---|---|
| `TagLaunchTemplateOnCreate` (`ec2:CreateTags`) | Tags applied by `CreateLaunchTemplate`. Bounded with `ec2:CreateAction` to that call, which itself requires the `Project` tag. |
